Then unzip the downloaded ZIP file and copy the unzipped content to a blank SD card.

This package uses a standalone autorun.brs file to load a HTML widget that loops video and images that are within the HtmlSite folder. This is a working example of how one can play a video then an image without any black frames during the transitions between video content and images and vice versa.
